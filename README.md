# Mini Map System (Wasalny)

An application written in C++ as a project for FCIS-ASU's data structures course. The app is an application of graph theory as it allows users to add or remove cities and roads. The app can display the map, calculate the shortest path between two cities and calculate the shortest path connceting all cities if found.

## Features

- Users can add or remove cities and roads.
- Users can look at the whole map using DFS or BfS.
- Calculating the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Searching for the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's Algorithm or Prim's Algorithm.
- GUI using Qt.
- Saving Progress to files.
